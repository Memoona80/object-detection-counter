# object-detection-counter
An Arduino-based object/person counter using IR sensor and LCD display.
# Object Detection Counter (Arduino + IR Sensor + LCD)

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This project is an **object/person detection counter** built with an Arduino Uno, an IR sensor, and a 16x2 LCD display.  
Whenever an object (e.g., a person walking past or a hand wave) interrupts the IR sensor, the counter increases by one and is displayed on the LCD in real-time.

## ðŸŽ¯ Features
- Detects objects or people using an **IR sensor**.  
- Displays live count on a **16x2 LCD**.  
- Simple, low-cost, and beginner-friendly design.  
- Powered directly from Arduinoâ€™s **5V output**.
